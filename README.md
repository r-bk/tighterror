# *tighterror* - compact error types + codegen

**tighterror** is a Rust library and a set of accompanying tools for
compact representation of errors in Rust programs.

**tighterror** tries to achieve the following goals:

- minimize the size of error types while keeping support for idiomatic error reporting
- minimize the runtime overhead on error path; no dynamic memory allocation (by default)
- minimize the coding effort:
  - define errors in a markup language and generate boilerplate code automatically
  - ergonomic error reporting
